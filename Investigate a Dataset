<h2>Project 1 </h2> **Investigate a Dataset - TMDb Movie Data Analysis.**

In this project, I cleaned and analyzed the Movie Database (TMDb).
This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies.
I curated datasets from Database (TMDb) and investigated them using NumPy, and pandas, and Matplotlib. 
I completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.

1. Some questions are posed based on the data set that was investigated.
2. Cleaned the data from the dataset
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was implemented to find the information according to the research questions.
4. Finally, the conclusion is drawn and the ideas are shown through graphics.
